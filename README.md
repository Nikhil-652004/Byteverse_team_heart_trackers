The builded android app runs on devices from Android 8.0(Oreo)

This app required following permissions:
1)Location services - Precise or Approximate (Based on users requirement)
 We prefer Precise for best efficieny usage of app services.

Instructions:

->When user click on start,the app searches for "HeartRate Monitoring" devices like smartwatch and smartband and it will show bluetooth device connected and begin start monitoring until user clicks on stop button
->If the user heartrate is above 120 BPM,the app will show notification which contains buttons "I am okay","I need help" and a timer
->If the user clicks "i am okay",nothing happens
->If the user clicks "i need help" or doesnt respond to SMS upon 2 minutes,then a emergency sms will be deployed to emergency contact provided with location info
